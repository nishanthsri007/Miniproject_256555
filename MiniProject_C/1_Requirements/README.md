# Requirements

### Introduction

 1. Here in this project,I have consisder the major problem that the students 
    face after getting their results.Some have the problem of calculating the
    GPA for a semester after getting result in the form of grade/gradepoint
    and some have the problem of calaculating the percentage/mark or the over
    all grade for the marks they obtained.

2. So consisdering this I have included all the calculation responsible for 
   grades to GPA conversions,Cumulative GPA of all semesters and the overall
   grade obtained based on your individual subject marks.


## Research

### Calculation of GPA based on the gradepoints obtained in each subjects in a semester

  GPA calculation is an important thing that every student and every management
  needs for ending up in a final value for the grade points obtained in all 
  the subjects in a particular semester.This is obtained taking the gradepoints
  of all the subjects as input and with applying the necessary formulas to
  the problem the output can be obtained.*
  
  ### Calculation of CGPA based on all the GPA obatined in all the semesters
  
  CGPA calculation is another important aspect that every student and every 
  management needs for ending up in a final value as the final grade of a 
  student in his graduation.This is obtained taking the GPA of all the semesters
  as input and with applying the necessary formulas to the problem the output 
  can be obtained.
  
  ### Gradepoint predictor based on the marks obtained in individual subjects
  
  Gradepoint is something which is essential for all high school students and
  students to obtain a cumulative final grade based on the marks they obtain
  in their individual subjects.This is obtained taking the marks of all the 
  subjects as input and with applying the necessary formulas to the problem
  the output can be obtained.
  
  ## Benefits
  
  The students can easily calaculate their GPA,CGPA and the overall grades by
  using only this calculator just by applying their gradepoints,marks in their
  respective subjects.
  
  # Cost and Features 
  
  ### Feature 
  
  All the exixting calculators have any of the one feature I included in my
  projects.
  Here you can find all three features
  1. GPA calculator
  2. CGPA calculator
  3. Overall gradepoint predictor
  in a single application.
  
  # Defining our system
  
  This application involves combination of three calculators
  1. GPA calculator
  2. CGPA calculator
  3. Overall gradepoint predictor 
   
  ### Explanation
  
  GPA calculation is obtained taking the gradepoints
  of all the subjects as input and with applying the necessary formulas to
  the problem the output can be obtained.
  CGPA calculation is obtained taking the GPA of all the semester as input
  and with applying the necessary formulas to the problem the output can be 
  obtained.
  Gradepoint is obtained taking the marks of all the subjects as input and 
  with applying the necessary formulas to the problem the output can be 
  obtained.

  # 4W's and 1'H
  
  ### Who:
  Applications providing either one of the features
  1. GPA calculator
  2. CGPA calculator
  3. Overall gradepoint predictor 

  ### What :
  All the applications have not provided with all these three features 
  together. They have either used GPA calculation or CGPA calculation or 
  the Grade predictor.
  
  ### When:
  It began when online marksheet generation started and people started
  predicting their marks based on the grades obtained.
  
  ### Where:
  GPA calculations involves all the students and the universities who 
  get the gradepoints and work with grades and gradepoints respectively.
  
  ### How:
  Students can convert thier results in any form either in grade format or 
  in the gradepoint format or in the gpa format.
